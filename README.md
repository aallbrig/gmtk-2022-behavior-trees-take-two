## GMTK 2022 Project: Behavior Trees take two

I really want to author a behavior tree implementation. To do this, I will create a tribute to halo. Halo was the series that popularized BTs in video games and prove to be vital in game entity a.i.

I wish myself luck. Luck that only a dice can provide.

## My idea
...Has nothing to do with the game jam. I just want to get a good behavior tree implementation going.

Halo. Halo. Halo.
